		<h2>Follow these rules</h2>
		<p class="description">
			On a turn, a player rolls the dice ðŸŽ² once or repeatedly. The goal is to accumulate as many points as
			possible, adding up (hold) the numbers rolled on the dice ðŸŽ². However, if a player rolls a 1, the player's
			turn is over and any points they have accumulated during this turn are forfeited. Rolling a 1 doesn't wipe
			out your entire score from previous turns, just the total earned during that particular roll. A player has
			to choose to hold (stop rolling the dice ðŸŽ²) if they do not want to take a chance of rolling a 1 and losing
			all of their points from this turn. If the player chooses to hold, all of the points rolled during that turn
			are added to his or her total score. When a player reaches a total of 100 points, the game ends and that
			player is the winner.
